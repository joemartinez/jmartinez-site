      <p class="top-p">Hello, my name is Joseph Martinez. I am a Senior at the University of Toledo and am an Information Technology major. At the moment, I don't have much free time due to working full-time while being a full time student. </p>

      <p class="bot-p">Some other hobbies that I dabble in are riding motorcycles when it is not snowing, working out, and spending time with friends and family. </p>
